# Wine Snob Edition
I'll be training and turning a random forest for wine quality (as judged by wine snobs experts) based on traits like acidity, residual sugar, and alcohol concentration.

I'll be using Scikit-Learn, also known as sklearn for this project.

I will try to include notes in the notebooks and comments in the .py

Thanks
